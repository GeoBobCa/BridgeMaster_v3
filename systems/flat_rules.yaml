    explanation: The standard strong notrump. Known for its clarity and immediate limit on the hand's strength.
    nuance: ACBL regulations require the range to be announced as 'fourteen plus to seventeen'. If the hand is 12-14 or 18-19 balanced, you must open a suit first and rebid notrump. This opening can include a five-card major suit as long as the hand is balanced.
